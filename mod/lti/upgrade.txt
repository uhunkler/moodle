This files describes API changes in the lti code.

=== 2.8 ===

* The field 'grade' in the table {lti} is now an integer rather than a numeric to bring it
  in line with the 'grade' field in other activities.

=== 2.7 ===

* mod_lti\event\unknown_service_api_called now has less data stored in 'other'
  but everything is still available for event observers via method get_message_data()
